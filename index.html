                    Hence Eid ul Adha celebrates Ibrahim's (Abraham's) obedience to carry out Allah's decree by offering
                    his
                    son
                    Ismail (Ishmael) as a sacrifice. But before Ibrahim could offer his son as a sacrifice, God gave him
                    a
                    lamb,
                    which he was to sacrifice in place of his son.

                        the sacrifice of Prophet Abraham on the day of Eid ul-Adha. Muslims all around the world perform
                        this salah twice a year, and the method is different from the daily prayers. It consists of two
                        rak'ahs (units of prayer)

                    <h1>Importance of </h1>
                    <h1>Eid ul Adha</h1>
                    <br>
                    <p>Eid ul Adha is an annual celebration of the Islamic faith. Commemorating the story of Ibrahim's
                        unwavering belief in Allah, it focuses on sacrifice, devotion, charity, and compassion. Muslims
                        enthusiastically celebrate this auspicious festival to honor and remember Ibrahim's loyalty
                        toward Allah every year. </p>

                    <br>

                    <p>
                        The celebration of big Eid reminds Muslims of Ibrahim's willingness to sacrifice his beloved son
                        to show his utter devotion to Allah. This prompts devotees to consider their own obedience and
                        devotion to Allah. This day provides Muslims with a chance to seek forgiveness for the times
                        when they have failed to fully devote themselves to Allah and pray for the strength needed to
                        remain devoted in the future.

                    <p>During greater Eid, Muslims dress in new or properly washed clothes. They visit the mosque to
                        pray and thank Allah for the blessings they have received. Also called Eid Salaah, people offer
                        Eid prayers in the congregation on the morning of Eid at the nearest mosque. These prayers
                        consist of two Rakats (units), the first of which has seven Takbirs while the second has five
                        Takbirs. The prayer is followed by the sermon or Khutbah by the Imam.</p>

                        sacrifice is divided into three equal parts: one of which is taken by the one who offers the
                        sacrifice, the second is distributed amongst family and friends, and the rest is given to the
                        needy and poor.</p>

                        wear their best clothes and prepare delicious feasts. Muslims also embrace each other and
